# ⭐ Ternary CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

- The ternary operator only returns a VALUE
- It does not print anything
- A condition is checked →
  - If true → the first value is returned
  - If false → the second value is returned
- The returned value is stored in the variable on the left-hand side.

Example:  
```int x = (a > b) ? a : b;```  
This means `x` will receive either `a` or `b`, whichever satisfies the condition.
